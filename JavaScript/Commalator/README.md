<h1 align="center">COMMALATOR</h1>

Commalator is a simple program to sums up a line of number separated by comma. It's just like a calculator but only for summing up a number. this idea comes up when i'm in a situation where i urgently need to sums up some weight of box, and personally i just kind of confused when using a usual calculator.
